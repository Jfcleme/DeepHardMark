## Introduction
DeepHardMark is the first watermarking framework targeted at protecting deep 
learning hardware accelerators from piracy. DeepHardMark was orignally published in the work 
[DeepHardMark: Towards Watermarking Neural Network Hardware](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20367) This repository contains python 
scripts for running the DeepHardMark algorithm.  

## DeepHardMark+

An extension of DeepHardMark, which significantly improves on both the efficiency and effectiveness of of embedding watermarks has been developed. Our implementation of this improved algorithm can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/Jfcleme/Hardware-Watermarks-for-Deep-Learning-Systems).
